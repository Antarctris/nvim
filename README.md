# Antarctris' neovim init.lua

This init.lua is heavily inspired by 

* https://github.com/ThePrimeagen/neovimrc
* https://github.com/nvim-lua/kickstart.nvim

This was not forked but typed from scratch - with the premise to only type what I learned to understand.
This way I had to learn the things I wanted to use.
